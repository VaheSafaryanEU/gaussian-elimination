#gaussian-elimination

This project was developed for the courses taught at the European University in Yerevan. 


It contains three codes written in Python, Java Script and C++ programming languages that are used to determine the solution to systems of linear equations using the Gauss method.


To find the answer, you need to enter the data in the file matrix.txt and run one of the implementations.
